        <h2>1. Warm up </h2>
        <p>
            Kick-start your workout with about 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio. Activities such as cycling, push-ups, or jogging increase blood flow and warm up your muscle groups.

            It also prepares the body for the upcoming workout. You may find it helpful to include stretches for your shoulders, chest, and triceps during warm-ups.

        <h2>2.Deadlifts: </h2>
        <p>
           
Deadlifts are a compound exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, including the hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and various muscles in the upper body. It's crucial to perform deadlifts with proper form to prevent injury and maximize their effectiveness. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a conventional deadlift:

Conventional Deadlift:<br>

 1 Setup:

Stand with your feet hip-width apart. The barbell should be positioned over the middle of your feet.
The barbell should be close to your shins, with your toes pointing slightly outward.<br>
2 Grip:

Bend at your hips and knees to lower your body.
Grip the barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart. You can choose between a double overhand grip or a mixed grip (one hand pronated, one supinated) for a stronger hold.<br>
3 Body Position:

Keep your back straight, chest up, and shoulders pulled back.
Engage your core for stability.<br>
4 Lift:

Initiate the lift by driving through your heels, straightening your hips and knees simultaneously.
Keep the barbell close to your body as you lift.
Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.<br>
5 Lockout:

Stand up straight with your shoulders pulled back.
Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.
Avoid leaning back excessively.<br>
6 Lowering the Bar:

Hinge at your hips and bend your knees to lower the bar back to the ground.
Keep the bar close to your body during the descent.<br>
7 Tips:

Start with a light weight to practice proper form before adding more weight.
Warm up adequately before attempting heavy deadlifts.
Keep the barbell close to your body throughout the lift to minimize stress on your lower back.
Focus on a controlled descent to avoid injury.<br>
8 Variations:
There are variations of deadlifts, such as sumo deadlifts and Romanian deadlifts, which target muscles slightly differently. Make sure to incorporate a variety of deadlift variations into your routine for a well-rounded approach.

If you're new to deadlifting or have any concerns about your form, consider seeking guidance from a fitness professional. They can provide feedback and ensure that you're performing the exercise safely and effectively.<br>
