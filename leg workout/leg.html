        <h2>1. Warm up </h2>
        <p>
            Kick-start your workout with about 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio. Activities such as cycling, push-ups, or jogging increase blood flow and warm up your muscle groups.

            It also prepares the body for the upcoming workout. You may find it helpful to include stretches for your shoulders, chest, and triceps during warm-ups.

        <h2>2.Barbell Squats:</h2>
        <p>
            The barbell squat is a compound exercise that targets multiple muscle groups in the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform the barbell squat with proper form:<br>


Setup:<br>

1 Position the Bar: Start by setting the barbell on the squat rack at about chest height. Ensure that the bar is centered and secured on the rack.

Adjust the Bar Height: Adjust the height of the squat rack so that when you step under the bar, it rests comfortably on your upper back, just below the base of your neck.

Load the Bar: Add weight plates to both sides of the bar. The amount of weight will depend on your strength and fitness level. Start with a manageable weight until you are comfortable with the movement.<br>


2 Starting Position:

Stand facing the bar with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Step under the bar and position it across your upper back. The bar should rest on the meaty part of your traps, not on your neck.<br>
3 Grip the Bar:

Grasp the bar with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your palms should be facing forward.<br>
4 Position Your Body:

Step back from the rack, keeping your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider.
Point your toes slightly outward to accommodate your natural hip and knee alignment.<br>
5 Brace Your Core:

Take a deep breath and brace your core. This helps stabilize your spine during the lift.<br>
6 Descend into the Squat:

Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
Lower your body by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously.
Keep your chest up and maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.<br>
7 Depth:

Ideally, lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground or below parallel if you have the flexibility and strength to do so.<br>
8 Ascend:

Push through your heels to drive yourself back up to the starting position.
Keep your core engaged and maintain a straight back as you ascend.<br>
9 Lockout:

Stand tall and straighten your hips and knees at the top of the movement.<br>

        <h2>3. Deadlifts:</h2>
        <p>
            The deadlift is a compound exercise that primarily targets the muscles in the posterior chain, including the lower back, glutes, hamstrings, and also works the muscles in the core and upper back. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform the conventional barbell deadlift with proper form:<br>


            
            1 Bar Placement: Start by placing a barbell on the ground. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with your midfoot centered under the bar.<br>
            
            2 Grip: Bend at your hips and knees to lower your body, and grasp the bar with both hands using a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder-width. You can choose between a double overhand grip (both palms facing you) or a mixed grip (one palm facing you, one palm facing away).
            
            Hand Placement: Your hands should be placed just outside your knees.<br>
            
            3 Foot Position: Position your feet so that the bar is over the middle of your feet. Your toes can be slightly turned out.<br>
            
            4 Stance: Your stance can vary, but a common starting point is to have your feet about hip-width apart.<br>
            
          
            
            5 Set Your Back:
            
            Engage your lats by pulling your shoulder blades back and down.
            Maintain a neutral spine by keeping your back flat. Do not round your lower back.
            Lift Your Chest: Lift your chest and look straight ahead to help maintain a neutral spine.<br>
            
            6 Lift the Bar:
            
            Push through your heels, straightening your hips and knees simultaneously.
            As the bar passes your knees, extend your hips fully by thrusting them forward.<br>
            7 Stand Tall:
            
            Stand up straight, keeping the barbell close to your body throughout the lift.<br>
            8 Lower the Bar:
            
            To lower the bar, push your hips back first, then bend your knees.
            Keep the bar close to your body as it descends.<br>
            9 Return to Starting Position:
            
            Once the bar reaches the ground, you're back at the starting position.<br>
