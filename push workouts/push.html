        <h2>1. Warm up </h2>
        <p>
            Kick-start your workout with about 5 to 10 minutes of light cardio. Activities such as cycling, push-ups, or jogging increase blood flow and warm up your muscle groups.

            It also prepares the body for the upcoming workout. You may find it helpful to include stretches for your shoulders, chest, and triceps during warm-ups.

        <h2>2. Bench press</h2>
        <p>
            The bench press is a popular exercise that works on the muscle groups of your upper body. It is effective in chest muscle development, which can increase 10 to 20% in muscle thickness over 3 months.[4]

It also works on the triceps, promoting its growth. If you ever choose to focus on a single exercise to enhance your upper body muscles, the bench press is a great choice.

             It typically works on your front and middle deltoids and triceps. Your entire body is also active during this exercise.
