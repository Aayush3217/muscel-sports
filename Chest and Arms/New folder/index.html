        <h2> 1. Warm-Up</h2>
        <p>
            Start with 5-10 minutes of light cardiovascular exercise, such as jogging or jumping jacks, to increase
            blood flow to your muscles. Follow this with dynamic stretches for the shoulders, chest, and arms.

        <h2>2. Bench Press</h2>
        <p>
            The bench press is a popular strength training exercise that primarily targets the muscles of the chest,
            shoulders, and triceps. It is a compound exercise, meaning it involves multiple joints and muscle groups.
            Here's a basic overview of how to perform a bench press:<br>

            <b><i><u>Equipment:</u></i></b><br>
            1. <b>Bench:</b> You'll need a flat bench designed for weightlifting.<br>
            2. <b>Barbell:</b> Use a standard barbell, which typically weighs 45 pounds (20.4 kg) for men and 35 pounds
            (15.9
            kg) for women.<br>
            3.<b>Weights:</b> Add weight plates on each side of the barbell to increase resistance<br>

            <b><i><u>Execution:</u></i></b><br>
            1.<b>Unrack the Bar:</b> Lift the barbell from the rack and position it directly above your chest with your
            arms
            fully extended.<br>
            2.<b>Lower the Bar:</b> Lower the barbell to your chest in a controlled manner. Keep your elbows at a
            90-degree
            angle or slightly lower.<br>
            3.<b>Press the Bar:</b> Push the barbell back up to the starting position, extending your arms fully.<br>

        <h2>3. Incline Dumbbell Press</h2>
        <P>

            The incline dumbbell press is a variation of the traditional bench press that specifically targets the upper
            chest muscles. This exercise is performed on an inclined bench, and it offers a different range of motion
            compared to the flat bench press. Here's how you can perform the incline dumbbell press:<br>

            <b><i><u>Equipment:</u></i></b><br>
            1. <b>Incline Bench:</b> Use an adjustable bench set to an incline of around 15 to 30 degrees.<br>
            2. <b>Dumbbells:</b>Choose a pair of dumbbells that you can lift with control.<br>

            <b><i><u>Execution:</u></i></b><br>
            1.<b>Setup on the Bench:</b> Adjust the incline bench to your desired angle. Sit on the bench with a
            dumbbell in each hand, and place them on your thighs.<br>
            2.<b>Grip the Dumbbells:</b> With your palms facing forward, use your thighs to help lift the dumbbells one
            at a time to shoulder height. Hold the dumbbells with an overhand grip.<br>
            3.<b>Starting Position:</b> Lie back on the incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand. Position the
            dumbbells directly above your shoulders, arms fully extended.<br>
            4.<b>Lower the Dumbbells:</b> In a controlled manner, lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest. Keep
            your elbows at a 90-degree angle or slightly lower.<br>
            5.<b>Press the Dumbbells:</b> Push the dumbbells back up to the starting position, fully extending your
            arms.<br>
